# Men and women

## General thoughts

When discussing gender roles, feminism, sexism, etc, I think that the **setting** is extremely important (and that is the first thing that should be agreed upon by
everyone participating on a debate).

The situation of women (and men) in, say, Muslim Africa and North-West Europe, are so different that the same principles do not necessarily apply.
I think a big deal of the confusion, clashes and offence generated by this debate stems from overlooking that fact.

I agree with classical feminist principles and actions where women are clearly discriminated, dominated, disenfranchised.

But I oppose feminism (classical or otherwise) in all places where *any* of these statements are true:
* Where women face no significant disadvantages overall.
* Where those disadvantages are marginal, or restricted to a few specific aspects.
* Where those disadvantages are, at the present time, being overcome at a rapid pace and increasingly condemned by public opinion.
* Where women are favoured over men overall.

## &ldquo;Rape culture&rdquo;, trigger warnings, microaggressions

## The use of language

## On taking offence

## The situation of men in secular, liberal democracies
