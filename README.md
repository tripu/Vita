My own universe's how-to, life's user manual, instructions to navigate the Earth, tips for tripu, notes to self.

## Note to the casual reader

I use this public repository as a notepad for a very broad variety of **rough ideas** and **personal musings**.

I like to reflect on lots of subjects (as do most other human beings, I would presume).
Apart from the universal interests (life, love, the pursuit of happiness, financial planning, etc), there are some specific subjects that I find fascinating
(philosophy, ethics, politics, economics, gender issues, technology, books&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;among others).
As I go on living my life, reading, travelling, growing up, meeting people and talking to individuals I love or admire, I try to capture particular thoughts
that I find interesting as they cross my mind, appear on the page, or are uttered by someone else.

Usually, I feel that these ideas are not fit for other formats (essays, blog posts) for three reasons:
* These ideas are **too broad in their scope**: I want to ramble about any subject as it crosses my mind.
* At the same time, these ideas are **small**: I feel like I couldn't fill more than one page or two talking about my views on some important aspect of life
  *and be original*.
  I can express most of these thoughs in a very succint way, and that's enough (&ldquo;I think *X* is important&rdquo;, &ldquo;I don't believe in *Y*&rdquo;,
  &ldquo;I shall *Z* every morning if I want to stay healthy and live long&rdquo;).
* These ideas are **half-cooked** (because I'm alive, changing my mind, feeling silly), and therefore not ripe to share with the world in a formal way, with a
  minimum level of confidence.

So I think a *digital scratchpad* like this repository is the perfect container.
Git is a version-control system; designed to handle stuff that needs to be changed, fixed and reworked permanently; with the ability to *travel in time* to look
anything as it was at some point in the past&hellip;
That is exactly what I need for these thoughts.

Bear in mind that this project is as personal as a public project can ever be.

(Needless to say, I'm stopping short of disclosing *really intimate thoughts* here.)

Did I mention already that the thoughts collected here are **personal** and **temporary**, a permanent **work in progress**?

Anyway, here are some actions you can take if you find an error in my reasoning (of course there will be plenty of those), or if you are offended by some of my
ideas:
* [Fork this repo](https://github.com/tripu/Vita/#fork-destination-box), and submit a pull request.
* Stay outraged, refuse to apply the [principle of charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity) and label me as you please.
* Grow up.
