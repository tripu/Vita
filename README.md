My own universe's how-to, life's user manual, instructions to navigate the Earth, tips for tripu, notes to self.

## Note to the casual reader

I use this public repository as a notepad for a very broad variety of **rough ideas** and **personal musings**.

I like to reflect on lots of subjects (as do most other human beings, I would presume).
Apart from the universal interests (life, love, the pursuit of happiness, financial planning, etc), there are some specific subjects that I find fascinating
(politics, economics, technology, ethics, books&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;among others).
As I go on living my life, reading, travelling, growing up, meeting people and talking to individuals I love or admire, I try to capture particular thoughts
that I find interesting as they cross my mind, appear on the page, or are uttered by someone else.
(Needless to say, I'm stopping short of disclosing *really intimate thoughts* here.)

Bear in mind that this project is as personal as a public project can ever be.

Did I mention already that the thoughts collected here are **personal** and **half-cooked**, a permanent **work in progress**?

Anyway, here are some actions you can take if you find an error in my reasoning (of course there will be plenty of those), or if you are offended by some of my
ideas:
* [Fork this repo](https://github.com/tripu/Vita/#fork-destination-box), and submit a pull request.
* Stay outraged, refuse to apply the [principle of charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity) and label me as you please.
* Grow up.
