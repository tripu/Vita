## 1. Democracy

Directly asking the citizens (through referenda, polls) isn't *always* the right thing to do.
It seems counter-intuitive, but I think there are cases when casting votes isn't the best way to decide policies.
Why?
Populist governments.
Poorly framed questions.
Lack of sufficient information on the consequences of public decisions.
Spin doctors in parties and the corporate world.
The weak, short-sighted and selfish nature of human beings.

We elect politicians to delegate decisions, to have them carry the burden of unpopular measures, and to think hard on our behalf, *as well*.
Obviously, the extreme of this is an oligarchy, or a dictatorship.
I suspect there is a right &ldquo;amount of direct democracy&rdquo; somewhere along this spectrum.

Hint: if the opposite were true, democracy would *always* be healthier when politicians choose to hold referenda (instead of letting public institutions decide;
such as ministries, the parliament, the senate, technocrats, courts).
In other words, the ideal would be to have citizens casting their votes constantly (or, say, every Sunday) on most topics.
Given the rate at which criptography and mobile computing are progressing, that scenario seems feasible and affordable in the near future.
Still, are we sure that form of government would be a good thing&hellip;?

## 2. In general, the fewer laws, the better

That does not mean that there should be *no* rules.
It just means that the mere *existence* of a :triangular_flag_on_post:**law** (formal prescription) or of a social norm (informal prescription) *needs justification*, and that the
benefits of controlling, regulating or prohibiting certain aspect *have* to outweigh the benefits of not interfering with it.

## 3. I believe in rules

I reject authoritarianism, but I have realised that I place more value in :triangular_flag_on_post:**laws** and :triangular_flag_on_post:**rules** than most people.

I usually need a convincing explanation for acts that go against the law.
That is why, *in principle*, I oppose such things as:
* Squatting.
* *Escraches*.
* Non-authorised demonstrations.
* Non-authorised trikes.

And that is why, *in principle*, I am in favour of:
* Evictions.
* Deportation of illegal immigrants.

When I discuss specific cases, I generally agree with my progressive friends.
The subtle difference between our views is that many progressives too often defend acting against the law to fix broken situtations (eg, mobilising a large
group of people to stand before the police and prevent an eviction), while I usually defend the legal procedures but advocate *changing the law or those
procedures*.

There are some social phenomena that tend to approach too emotionally, and that trigger immediate rejection: when we look at illegal immigrants, for example,
most of us will sympathise with what are often terrible situations (poverty, social exclusion, exploitation).
I, like many others, support more compasive laws, more resources dedicated to combat discrimination, a welfare state that focus on people at the bottom of
society and minimises poverty and sickness.
What I think is wrong is to automatically, mindlessly, perpetuate the inertia of disobeying the laws&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;the laws that say illegal immigrants are
to be found, detained, questioned and perhaps eventually removed from the country.
That dynamic has taken us to a hypocritical status quo, a time when the POTUS can talk openly about not trying to clamp down on illegal immigrants, or about
giving them &ldquo;papers&rdquo;.
In other words: many politicians, those in power and the public opinion generally agree that those laws are wrong; but instead of working on changing them,
publicly and shamelessly advocate their disobedience.

It is the job of those in power to *follow* the laws.
If they find those laws immoral or unjust, it is their civic duty to do as much as they can to change them, or else resign from their job.
In the meantime, they are the guardians of those laws; if they don't respect and obey them, who will.
More so: if judges, policemen, elected politicians decide to openly ignore or subvert important laws, what argument will there be to persuade citizens not to do
the same whenever a law does not have their approval?

All this is not to say that I can't see the reasons behind, and the merits of, nonviolent civic resistance as a last resort, or against blatant injustice.
But I think that some of those types of actions have got too far; or are applied too often, too happily, by crowds that don't stop to reflect about what they
are doing.

For me, this respect for rules manifests itself in other ways in day-to-day life, too.
For example, I really can't understand why people litter on the street, smoke where it's forbidden, talk on their mobile phones where it's seen as very bad
manners, etc.

## 4. Political stance(s)

I am, more or less, a :triangular_flag_on_post:**liberal** or a :triangular_flag_on_post:**libertarian**, although I don't know enough yet to be sure I identify
fully with those movements.

* I am a liberal with respect to many/most typical :triangular_flag_on_post:**social issues** (gay rights, freedom of speech, euthanasia).
* **Fiscally**, I favour progressive, &ldquo;high&rdquo; :triangular_flag_on_post:**taxes** (of the sort you see nowadays in Scandinavian states).
* I believe in :triangular_flag_on_post:**free markets**, and in :triangular_flag_on_post:**capitalism**.

(For more about economics, see the note at the bottom \[The Economist\], and :point_right:[economics](economics.md#economics).)

Some people, influenced by stereotypes or by the particular &ldquo;baggage&rdquo; that these terms carry in their country, could say that these views are
contradictory.

:thought_balloon:For example, in Spain, in 2016, someone who defended gay rights and euthanasia (like me), and opposed bullfighting (as I do), would be
automatically assumed to be very suspicious of free markets, and an enemy of capitalism (which I am not).
:thought_balloon:Another example: today in the US, someone who is in favour of relatively high taxation and a welfare system (as I am) is probably seen as a
*leftie* who would like the state to meddle with the corporate world to impose high minimum wages and establish quotas for women and other minorities (but I
oppose that).

Although I realise that this particular combination of views might not be very common, in reality I don't stumble upon contradictions between these different
sets of beliefs that I hold.
Or so I think.
Let me know if you find holes in the reasonings I am sharing with you in these documents.

## 5. On voting

I used to think that :triangular_flag_on_post:**voting** is a civic duty; that regardless of what you think of the main parties, of the voting system, of the form of
state&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;voting is the way you express your ideas (if nothing else, at least by undervoting or casting a spoilt vote).

More recently though, I have been reading some radical opinions about the rotten voting system, the actual plutocracy of state-sponsored parties, and the
impossibility of changing &ldquo;the system&rdquo; from within, by acknowledging its rules and *voting*
(:bust_in_silhouette:[**Antonio Garc&iacute;a-Trevijano**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Garc%C3%ADa-Trevijano),
:bust_in_silhouette:[**John Stuart Mill**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill),
:bust_in_silhouette:**George Carlin**).

Those readings coincided in time with the general elections of 2015 in Spain, whose aftermath was (for me) a disheartening display of hipocrisy, vanity,
short-sightedness, lack of honest political discussion and the usual Spanish chauvinism.
The results of the elections were polarising: recent popular discontent gave rise to two new parties in the left and in the right that had promised to clean up
politics and reform the system.
Some of those strong promises of honesty and renovation vanished a mere few weeks after the elections, during the discussions to form a coalition that could
elect the new prime minister.
At the same time, the traditionally hegemonic parties (one in the left, another one in the right), which suffered a backlash, struggled to stay relevant in the
worst possible way: by dressing themselves as true reformists, adopting mindlessly the cheapest of political slogans, jumping in the wagon of political
marketing.

All that gave me thought.

I now wonder if **not voting** might be the most responsible thing to do&hellip;&nbsp;at least in Spain.

## 6. Political correctness

> &ldquo;*That playground of guilty white liberals: political correctness.
  Political correctness is America's newest form of intolerance.
  And it's especially pernicious because it comes disguised as tolerance.*&rdquo;

&mdash;&nbsp;George Carlin.
