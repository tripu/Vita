## Democracy

Directly asking the citizens (through referenda, polls) isn't *always* the right thing to do.
It seems counter-intuitive, but I think there are cases when casting votes isn't the best way to decide policies.
Why?
Populist governments.
Poorly framed questions.
Lack of sufficient information on the consequences of public decisions.
Spin doctors in parties and the corporate world.
The weak, short-sighted and selfish nature of human beings.

We elect politicians to delegate decisions, to have them carry the burden of unpopular measures, and to think hard on our behalf, *as well*.
Obviously, the extreme of this is an oligarchy, or a dictatorship.
I suspect there is a right &ldquo;amount of direct democracy&rdquo; somewhere along this spectrum.

Hint: if the opposite were true, democracy would *always* be healthier when politicians choose to hold referenda (instead of letting public institutions decide;
such as ministries, the parliament, the senate, technocrats, courts).
In other words, the ideal would be to have citizens casting their votes constantly (or, say, every Sunday) on most topics.
Given the rate at which criptography and mobile computing are progressing, that scenario seems feasible and affordable in the near future.
Still, are we sure that form of government would be a good thing&hellip;?

### In general, the fewer laws, the better

That doesn't mean there should be no rules, nor that [TODO]
