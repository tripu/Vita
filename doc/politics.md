## 1. Democracy

Directly asking the citizens (through referenda, polls) isn't *always* the right thing to do.
It seems counter-intuitive, but I think there are cases when casting votes isn't the best way to decide policies.
Why?
Populist governments.
Poorly framed questions.
Lack of sufficient information on the consequences of public decisions.
Spin doctors in parties and the corporate world.
The weak, short-sighted and selfish nature of human beings.

We elect politicians to delegate decisions, to have them carry the burden of unpopular measures, and to think hard on our behalf, *as well*.
Obviously, the extreme of this is an oligarchy, or a dictatorship.
I suspect there is a right &ldquo;amount of direct democracy&rdquo; somewhere along this spectrum.

Hint: if the opposite were true, democracy would *always* be healthier when politicians choose to hold referenda (instead of letting public institutions decide;
such as ministries, the parliament, the senate, technocrats, courts).
In other words, the ideal would be to have citizens casting their votes constantly (or, say, every Sunday) on most topics.
Given the rate at which criptography and mobile computing are progressing, that scenario seems feasible and affordable in the near future.
Still, are we sure that form of government would be a good thing&hellip;?

## 2. In general, the fewer laws, the better

That does not mean that there should be *no* rules.
It just means that the mere *existence* of a :triangular_flag_on_post:**law** (formal prescription) or of a social norm (informal prescription) *needs justification*, and that the
benefits of controlling, regulating or prohibiting certain aspect *have* to outweigh the benefits of not interfering with it.

## 3. I believe in rules

I reject authoritarianism, but I have realised that I place more value in :triangular_flag_on_post:**laws** and :triangular_flag_on_post:**rules** than most people.

I usually need a convincing explanation for acts that go against the norms.
That is why, *in principle*, I oppose such things as: squatting, *escraches*, non-authorised demonstrations or strikes, or resistance to evictions.

That is not to say that I can't see the reasons behind, and the merits of, nonviolent civic resistance as a last resort, or against blatant injustice.
But I think that some of those types of actions have got too far; or are applied too often, too happily, by crowds that don't stop to reflect about what they are
doing.

For me, this respect for rules manifests itself in other ways in day-to-day life, too.
For example, I really can't understand why people litter on the street, smoke where it's forbidden, talk on their mobile phones where it's seen as very bad
manners, etc.

## 4. Political stance(s)

I am, more or less, a :triangular_flag_on_post:**liberal** or a :triangular_flag_on_post:**libertarian**, although I don't know enough yet to be sure I identify fully with those movements.

* I am a liberal with respect to many/most typical :triangular_flag_on_post:**social issues** (gay rights, freedom of speech, euthanasia).
* **Fiscally**, I favour progressive, &ldquo;high&rdquo; :triangular_flag_on_post:**taxes** (of the sort you see nowadays in Scandinavian states).
* I believe in free markets, and in capitalism.

(For more about economics, see the note at the bottom \[The Economist\], and :point_right:[economics](economics.md).)

Some people, influenced by stereotypes or by the particular &ldquo;baggage&rdquo; that these terms carry in their country, could say that these views are
contradictory.

For example, in Spain in 2016, someone who defended gay rights and euthanasia, and opposed bullfighting (as I do), would be automatically assumed to be
very suspicious of free markets, and an enemy of capitalism (which I am not).
Today in the US, someone who is in favour of relatively high taxation and a welfare system (as I am) is probably seen as a *leftie* who would like the state to
meddle with the corporate world to impose high minimum wages and establish quotas for women and other minorities (but I oppose that).

Although I realise that this particular combination of views might not be very common, in reality I don't stumble upon contradictions between these different
sets of beliefs that I hold.
Or so I think.
Let me know if you find holes in the reasonings I am sharing with you in these documents.

## 5. On voting

I used to think that :triangular_flag_on_post:**voting** is a civic duty; that regardless of what you think of the main parties, of the voting system, of the form of
state&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;voting is the way you express your ideas (if nothing else, at least by undervoting or casting a spoilt vote).

More recently though, I have been reading some radical opinions about the rotten voting system, the actual plutocracy of state-sponsored parties, and the
impossibility of changing &ldquo;the system&rdquo; from within, by acknowledging its rules and *voting*
(:bust_in_silhouette:[**Antonio Garc&iacute;a-Trevijano**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Garc%C3%ADa-Trevijano),
:bust_in_silhouette:[**John Stuart Mill**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_Stuart_Mill),
:bust_in_silhouette:**George Carlin**).

Those readings coincided in time with the general elections of 2015 in Spain, whose aftermath was (for me) a disheartening display of hipocrisy, vanity,
short-sightedness, lack of honest political discussion and the usual Spanish chauvinism.
The results of the elections were polarising: recent popular discontent gave rise to two new parties in the left and in the right that had promised to clean up
politics and reform the system.
Some of those strong promises of honesty and renovation vanished a mere few weeks after the elections, during the discussions to form a coalition that could
elect the new prime minister.
At the same time, the traditionally hegemonic parties (one in the left, another one in the right), which suffered a backlash, struggled to stay relevant in the
worst possible way: by dressing themselves as true reformists, adopting mindlessly the cheapest of political slogans, jumping in the wagon of political
marketing.

All that gave me thought.

I now wonder if **not voting** might be the most responsible thing to do&hellip;&nbsp;at least in Spain.
