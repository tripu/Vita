### 1. Literature

#### 1.1. What to read

Do not waste time on trendy best-sellers.
Life is short, and [there are only so many books you can read](https://twitter.com/quintanapaz/status/648637741488566273).

Prefer classics over contemporary authors; they have endured the test of time.

A meta-aggregator of quality rankings like [The Greatest Books](http://www.thegreatestbooks.org/) is really useful.

#### 1.2. Writing

Prerequisites for good writing, [according to Steven Pinker](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=9GubdYZPYPg):

1. Spend an enormous amount of time consuming the good prose of others
1. Adopt the right mindset, the right pretense
1. Overcome the &ldquo;curse of knowledge&rdquo;
1. Be coherent
