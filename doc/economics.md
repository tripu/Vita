## Jobs aren't sacred

See the [*parable of the broken window*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Parable_of_the_broken_window).

Who misses night watchmen nowadays?
Who misses physical travel agencies?
How is the society worse off after the demise of those job occupations, and models of business?

Sinecures are never good.

*Reductio ad absurdum*: &ldquo;if unnecessary, redundant or low-productivity occupations were good for society because, well, they provide jobs, then making up
pointless occupations would be sound economic policy&rdquo;.

### Example

Imagine that more thoughtful citizens and technological progress make it possible to reduce the number of waste collectors by 10%, while keeping the
same level of service.
Some may think that it's bad news: *&ldquo;we should keeep those people on the payroll, and secure their jobs, for the greater good of society, and the
economy as a whole&rdquo;*.
In other words, they think that having 1000 waste collectors in the city is better, in the long run, than having only 900.

But if that were true, why stop there?
Why not *increase* overnight the number of waste collectors by 10%?
Surely that would benefit society even more.

*&ldquo;Wait, that is absurd.
What are those extra 10% of workers going to do anyway?
With the current number the job is done OK!&rdquo;*

No problem there.
Just consider that our grandparents probably faced the same dilemma when petrol-powered trucks made waste-collection much more fast and efficient.
They were reckless enough as to allow those machines take over the job of *people*.
We can amend that error now: let's bring back horses and carts.
Now we have that extra 10% of waste collectors, all performing at their peak, and getting the same job done.

The contradiction is clear.

Every time you're tempted to protect a particular guild or model of business against the progress of the mindsets and technology, [TODO]

## Offshoring is good

If you complain about a company taking its activity overseas (to cheaper markets), you are thinking primarily as a (privileged) inhabitant of the first world.
Offshoring is, no doubt, good news for developing countries.

If you choose to judge changes by a humanistic, non-chauvinistic light (as I think you should), you'll realise that the net gain of offshoring for *humanity*
or *the society* (as opposed to this country, or that other country) is positive.
Companies offshoring to cheaper countries are the communicating vessels of the (global) economy.

That does not mean we should be OK with miserable working conditions, unfair wages, increases in pollution or child workers!
But to use those arguments [TODO]

Letting people migrate (or even getting rid of borders altogether) also
[makes economic sense](http://www.theatlantic.com/business/archive/2015/10/get-rid-borders-completely/409501/).
