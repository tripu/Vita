### 1. Rules of discourse

* The difficulty in establishing fair/appropriate boundaries or cut-off points in moral questions that come in gradations does not mean that no boundaries are
  appropriate (ie, that an absolute, binary answer is the right one).
  ðŸ’­&nbsp;Example: even &ldquo;pro-choice&rdquo; people concede that big, perfectly viable, completely formed fetuses should not be aborted in the last
  days of pregnancy; and many &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; advocates do not oppose interrupting the gestation of an embryos a few hours after fertilisation.
  The &ldquo;cut-off&rdquo; after which abortion is immoral is very contingent.
  That proves that no abortion is moral / all abortions are moral.
  (**Wrong reasoning**.)
  ðŸ’­&nbsp;Example: it is very difficult to discern exactly how much a person has to earn to keep their dignity; therefore the idea of imposing a
  minimum wage is absurd.
  (**Wrong reasoning**.)
  ðŸ’­&nbsp;Example: the vast majority of those who defend the right of any citizen to own any kind of firearm would admit that there should be a limit
  (eg, individuals should not produce/own [ICBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile)'s, or
  [WMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction)'s like biological or nuclear weapons).
  Similarly, virtually everybody thinks that it is okay for regular people to own chef's knives, camping knives, rat poison, and many other utensils that are
  sometimes used to kill people.
  It would be **wrong reasoning** to either conclude that because we know it is okay for citizens to own knifes, then they should be free to own *any* kind of
  weapon; and the opposite: because it is clearly immoral to let anyone build nuclear or biological weapons without control, it follows that also less deadly
  weapons (like pistols) should be banned.
* The fact that individuals cannot perceive, measure and confirm every aspect of the natural world first-hand seems to suggest that the
  [&ldquo;argument from authority&rdquo; fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority)
* Certain characteristics are void in the scope of good reasoning:
  * **Tradition** (custom and habit justified so many barbaric ideas and practices).
  * **Nature** (the fact that something is *artificial* does not necessarily mean it is worse than a more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; alternative).

### 2. Beliefs I cannot justify

I have a strong belief that <span class="icon idea">ðŸ’¡</span>&nbsp;**reading** is important, and makes me a better person, somehow.
In particular, I think that reading the classics, non-fiction, essays and books that are very influential or that explore complex subjects, improves me in some
way (as opposed to reading humourous books, thrilling novels and easy fiction: at least those types of reading hold a clear benefit since reading them is
entertaining *per se*).

However, I have not found arguments that convincing enough to justify this belief.

There is the &ldquo;old&rdquo; belief that smart people read, and read a lot; that books are indispensable to become sophisticated, educated, successful.
Although I have heard that all my life, when it comes to actually justifying the alleged benefits of reading, there is no clear evidence (I think).

One meets many people who seem smart, successful, witty, knowledgeable&hellip; but who admit to have read little, or very little, in their lives.
On the other hand, so many people who have been devouring books since an early age don't stand out in any particular way.
(Does the *kind* of books people read matter?)
All this is anecdotal evidence, of course.
But if the benefits are supposed to be so important, why don't we confirm this belief much more easily through experience?

Similarly, I believe that it's important to know <span class="icon idea">ðŸ’¡</span>&nbsp;**the news**, to be aware of what's happening around oneself and in the
world right now.
But there aren't good reasons to believe that.
<span class="icon ref">ðŸ‘‰</span>&nbsp;**[&ldquo;Broken breaking news&rdquo;](miscellanea.md#4-broken-breaking-news)**
<span class="icon ref">ðŸ‘‰</span>&nbsp;**[Aaron Swartz: *&ldquo;I Hate the News&rdquo;*](http://www.aaronsw.com/weblog/hatethenews)**

One tentative explanation that I have for this is that reading many books, and knowing well how the world works and what's going on (by following the news)
makes me more similar to people I like (because I've found that I like people who tend to read a lot and be very well informed).

### 3. Miscellanea

* There are absurd questions.
   * &ldquo;Do you prefer a universe with, or without a god?&rdquo;
* There are dishonest questions one can (should) ignore altogether.
