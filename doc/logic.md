## 1. Rules of discourse

* The difficulty in establishing fair/appropriate boundaries or cut-off points in moral questions that come in gradations does not mean that no boundaries are
  appropriate (ie, that an absolute, binary answer is the right one).
  ðŸ’­&nbsp;Example: even &ldquo;pro-choice&rdquo; people concede that big, perfectly viable, completely formed fetuses should not be aborted in the last
  days of pregnancy; and many &ldquo;pro-life&rdquo; advocates do not oppose interrupting the gestation of an embryos a few hours after fertilisation.
  The &ldquo;cut-off&rdquo; after which abortion is immoral is very contingent.
  That proves that no abortion is moral / all abortions are moral.
  (**Wrong reasoning**.)
  ðŸ’­&nbsp;Example: it is very difficult to discern exactly how much a person has to earn to keep their dignity; therefore the idea of imposing a
  minimum wage is absurd.
  (**Wrong reasoning**.)
  ðŸ’­&nbsp;Example: the vast majority of those who defend the right of any citizen to own any kind of firearm would admit that there should be a limit
  (eg, individuals should not produce/own [ICBM](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Intercontinental_ballistic_missile)'s, or
  [WMD](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weapon_of_mass_destruction)'s like biological or nuclear weapons).
  Similarly, virtually everybody thinks that it is okay for regular people to own chef's knives, camping knives, rat poison, and many other utensils that are
  sometimes used to kill people.
  It would be **wrong reasoning** to either conclude that because we know it is okay for citizens to own knifes, then they should be free to own *any* kind of
  weapon; and the opposite: because it is clearly immoral to let anyone build nuclear or biological weapons without control, it follows that also less deadly
  weapons (like pistols) should be banned.
* The fact that individuals cannot perceive, measure and confirm every aspect of the natural world first-hand seems to suggest that the
  [&ldquo;argument from authority&rdquo; fallacy](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Argument_from_authority)
* Certain characteristics are void in the scope of good reasoning:
  * **Tradition** (custom and habit justified so many barbaric ideas and practices).
  * **Nature** (the fact that something is *artificial* does not necessarily mean it is worse than a more &ldquo;natural&rdquo; alternative).

## 2. Miscellanea

* There are absurd questions.
   * &ldquo;Do you prefer a universe with, or without a god?&rdquo;
* There are dishonest questions one can (should) ignore altogether.
