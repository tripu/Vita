## Personality

1. [I](#1-i)
1. [In general](#2-in-general)

### 1. I

As a **rationalist** and a **cerebral** type, I'm more of a [**mistake theorist**](https://slatestarcodex.com/2018/01/24/conflict-vs-mistake/).
I'm also a [**high-decoupler**](https://unherd.com/2020/02/eugenics-is-possible-is-not-the-same-as-eugenics-is-good/).
(To me, the majority of people seem to be rather **passionate**, **conflict theorists** and/or **low-decouplers**, which often causes misunderstanding.

I think my [Myersâ€“Briggs personality type](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Myers%E2%80%93Briggs_Type_Indicator) is
[ISTJ (Introversion, Sensing, Thinking, Judgment)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ISTJ).

I have what Thomas Sowell calls [a constrained vision of the world](https://www.city-journal.org/thomas-sowell-race-poverty-culture).

### 2. In general

Although it's a gross simplification, I can usually classify people around me into two groups:

* **Left-brain dominant**: logical; realistic; introverted;  
  calm; dispassionate; facts-oriented;  
  like maths, the sciences and tech
* **Right-brain dominant**: intuitive; idealistic; extroverted;  
  excitable; emotional; feelings-oriented;  
  like language, spirituality and the arts

(Again: this is not scientifically accurate, but a heuristic I tend to apply, almost unconsciously.)

Often, I find it hard to interact with right-brain dominant people.
Conversation is difficult (not to mention debate).
