## Personality

1. [In short](#1-in-short)

### 1. In short

Although it's a gross simplification, I can usually classify people around me into two groups:

* **Left-brain dominant**: logical; realistic; introverted;  
  calm; dispassionate; facts-oriented;  
  like maths, the sciences and tech
* **Right-brain dominant**: intuitive; idealistic; extroverted;  
  excitable; emotional; feelings-oriented;  
  like language, spirituality and the arts

(Again: this is not scientifically accurate, but a heuristic I tend to apply, almost unconsciously.)

Often, I find it hard to interact with right-brain dominant people.
Conversation is difficult (not to mention debate).
