#### 1.1. Thinkers

* <span style="background-color: #80ff00;">ðŸ‘¤</span>&nbsp;[**Steven Pinker**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Steven_Pinker): kindness and an acute sense of humour
  are compatible with intellectual rigour, audacity and curiosity

These have pages on Wikipedia in the Spanish edition only:

* <span style="background-color: #80ff00;">ðŸ‘¤</span>&nbsp;[**Antonio Escohotado**](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Antonio_Escohotado): the very definition of a
  humanist, a learned person and a *thinker*; someone who has read *everything*, and has therefore the capacity to judge ideas based on the sources
* <span style="background-color: #80ff00;">ðŸ‘¤</span>&nbsp;[**Juan RamÃ³n Rallo**](https://es.wikipedia.org/wiki/Juan_Ram%C3%B3n_Rallo): a very articulate,
  unapologetic *classical liberal* (I find myself disagreeing with him from time to time, but I still admire his project and his approach to it)

#### 1.2. Artists

### 2. Famous people I detest

* <span style="background-color: #80ff00;">ðŸ‘¤</span>&nbsp;[**Katherine Spillar**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katherine_Spillar), executive editor of *Ms.*
  magazine.  
  Watch her &ldquo;answer&rdquo; these two questions, and try to contain your frustration at her hypocrisy and dishonesty:  
  [&ldquo;what reproductive eights do men have?&rdquo;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=8uyxANb6Ne0);
  [&ldquo;do feminists think men are disposable?&rdquo;](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wQr-XGM6vQo)
* <span style="background-color: #80ff00;">ðŸ‘¤</span>&nbsp;[**Pedro AlmodÃ³var**](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pedro_Almod%C3%B3var): Known internationally for
  his films, his political persona is that of a combatant leftist and progressive. However, deeds have repeatedly demonstrated that he's just narcissistic and
  greedy.
  In 2004, I collected three news items that told me he's a fraud.
  First, he endorsed a political documentary that was very critic of the conservative party then in power (PP, Popular Party), but [preferred to spend his time
  making yet another film instead of selflessly contributing to the film](https://elpais.com/diario/2004/03/06/espectaculos/1078527601_850215.html).
  Second, [he told international correspondents in Spain that the PP had been in the brink of organising a *coup
  d'Ã©tat* in Spain](http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/03/17/espana/1079512374.html) (an amazing hyperbole, and false for all we know).
  Lastly, and for all his love of democracy brotherly cooperation and civic responsibility, [he simply failed to show up on election date to do his duty one
  time that he was randomly chosen to serve as president at a polling station](http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2004/03/18/espana/1079604571.html).
