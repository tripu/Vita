How to treat children well.

1. [Day-to-day](#2-day-to-day)
1. [Speaking to them](#3-speaking-to-them)
1. [Language](#4-language)

### 1. General principles

* You can't use **reason** with children, not until a certain age.
  Don't fool yourself thinking that they will understand why they must or must not do something, if you only explain it to them well enough.
* Be radical always telling them the truth, except when that truth [TO-DO: exceptions?].
  In particular, never lie to them about fairy tales, mythical characters, Christmas presents, *magic*, sex, reproduction, their own place in the world and in
  society.
* Be very 💡&nbsp;**consistent** with rules, orders, reasons, prizes and punishment.
  Assume that every time you contradict yourself it will be detected, and it will be used against you next time.
* Never express any preference for one sibling over another.
  Resolve disputes in the most equitative way that is possible.
* Both parents have to be well aligned.
  Discrepancies have to be detected and discussed.

### 2. Day-to-day

* Be consistent with schedules and times.
  Exceptions should be that: exceptions.

### 3. Speaking to them

* Children aren't equipped yet to understand 💡&nbsp;**praise, criticism or sarcasm**&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;not like adults.
That means that there are certain things that adults usually say to each other safely, that may be confusing or even harmful for a child:
  * When **referring to them**, a child should never hear from their parents sentences like these:
    * *“She's so annoying, all the time screaming! One more day like today and I'll kill myself.”*
    * *“You know, honey. It was enough with the first one. If we could go back in time, we wouldn't have had him, would we?”*
    * *“I wish I've stayed today with his brother instead…”*
    * *“He's dragging behind his classmates.”*
    * *“He's the smartest in his class.”*
  * When **referring to other people**, also assume that ironic sentences will be interpreted literally.
    Statements that are violent, hyperbolic, sexist or racist aren't a good idea, neither.
    A child should never hear from their parents sentences that are sexist, racist or xenophobic.
    * *“Her classmates are kind of stupid, really.”*

### 4. Language

* Try to avoid the words 💡&nbsp;**blame** and 💡&nbsp;**fault**; use 💡&nbsp;**responsibility** instead.
* Try to avoid the words 💡&nbsp;**guilt** and 💡&nbsp;**guilty**.
* Do not simplify language more than strictly necessary.
  There's no harm in being exposed to *real*, adult language since an early age.
  If anything, it'll push them to absorb ideas and words, and start using them earlier.
