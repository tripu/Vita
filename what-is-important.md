* In most day–to–day situations, **#lying** is **bad** and shall be avoided. There are a number of circumstances, though, when lying is perfectly admisible — and even advisable. For instance, one shall not feel bad about lying to… [TO-DO]. Always telling the **#truth** is overrated.

* One shall take no **#offence** from sources one does not value or respect. If someone I despise call me a name, or tries to offend me, I can safely ignore them (as long as their public defamation or verbal violence doesn't actually affect my image or reputation).

* Weighing one's own selfish interests against abstract moral principles is one of the most tough tasks in life.

* Explicitely asserting **non–romantic #love** (to relatives and close friends) [seems to be necessary and have a huge positive impact on long—term happiness](http://paulgraham.com/todo.html). It isn't always natural nor easy, though.

* The **#merit of deeds** should be judged considering solely the information available **to that person** and **at the time actions were taken** — never considering their consequences, to the extend that they were impossible to predict.
Positive example: someone all of a sudden spends all their life savings on lottery tickets, and they win the biggest prize in history. Their call to spend all their money in lottery was still dumb and absolutely wrong (as it always is). Regardless of that fantastic but hugely unlikely outcome.
Negative example: [TO-DO].

* The balance between justly boasting about your merits and staying always humble is difficult.

* **#Fashion** as such must be ignored, as long as doing so does not put you in such an outdated or ridiculous position as to severely damage your image, reputation or relevant expectations of people about you. #Trends and #memes not backed by instrumental convenience or reason are pointless, and might even be expensive and time–consuming, so they can be safely ignored, too.
