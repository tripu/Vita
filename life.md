# What is important to me

## General principles, and making decisions

* The most important thing is your own **health**, **happiness** and **well-being**.
* Weighing one's own **selfish interests** against abstract **moral principles** is one of the most tough tasks in life.
Doing ***the right thing*** also when there's no-one looking.
Complying with rules even when the global consequences of doing otherwise are negligible or debatable.
Example: dodging a bit of your taxes.
* The **merit of deeds** should be judged considering solely the information available **to that person** and **at the time decisions were made, or actions were taken**&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;never considering their consequences, to the extent that they were impossible to predict.
Positive example: someone all of a sudden spends all their life savings on lottery tickets, and they win the biggest prize in history. Their call to spend all their money in lottery was still dumb and absolutely wrong (as it always is). Regardless of that fantastic but hugely unlikely outcome.
Negative example: [TO-DO].
* The balance between justly boasting about your merits and staying always humble is difficult.
* _“Decisions based on emotions aren't decisions at all.”_ (House of Cards, S01E12). One should not make non-trivial **decisions** in the heat of the moment.
* The idea of having, or achieving, “one's dream” (singular), or “the dream of one's life” seems weak, and maybe even noxious. By definition, pursuing such “dream” should be the ultimate goal in life, and its achievement has to bring immediate happiness at an unprecedented level. It seems imposible to know that beforehand. Also, circumstances, desires and priorities in life change wildly. But such an important, long-term “dream” should not be subject to those petty changes. Also, by achieving that goal (if you ever do that), you automatically downgrade your life, your ambitions and expectations, ie *nothing* can ever be as huge, as important, or as life-changing as achieving your dream in life, right?
* Always remember that you tend to idealise the **past**.

> *&ldquo;Relentlessly prune bullshit, don't wait to do things that matter, and savor the time you have. That's what you do when life is short.&rdquo;*
&mdash;&nbsp;[Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/vb.html).

> *&ldquo;Don't ignore your dreams; don't work too much; say what you think; cultivate friendships; be happy.&rdquo;*
&mdash;&nbsp;[Paul Graham](http://paulgraham.com/todo.html).

## People

* **People** around you, who are important to you, are the second most important thing.
* Explicitely asserting **non–romantic #love** (to relatives and close friends) [seems to be necessary and have a huge positive impact on long-term happiness](http://paulgraham.com/todo.html). It isn't always natural nor easy, though.
* **#Love** isn't an absolute, and it doesn't manifest itself in a perfect form. There is no “perfect match”, nor a “soul mate” ultimately waiting for you.
* In most day–to–day situations, **#lying** is **bad** and shall be avoided.
There are a number of circumstances, though, when lying is perfectly admisible&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;and even advisable.
Always telling the **#truth** is overrated.
Few valid exceptions to this rule may be lying (or simply hiding part of the truth) to: children, mentally incapable adults, terminally ill patients.
There are situations in which a *lack* of information is good for you.
But those are the exception.
* One shall take no **#offence** from sources one does not value or respect. If someone I despise call me a name, or tries to offend me, I can safely ignore them (as long as their public defamation or verbal violence doesn't actually affect my image or reputation).
* One can't **please everybody**. There isn't one way of being, behaving or talking that everybody always likes and approves. Even the most likeable, charming, thoughtful person can be annoying to some people, sometimes. Therefore, realising that somebody just doesn't like you, for no particular reasons, might well be irrelevant news&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;it doesn't always need to trigger self–evaluation nor reflection, let alone guilt.
* **When I see in other people habits or traits of personality that I despise**, sometimes it is because deep down I know I have that very same defect.
I'll do well if I stop and reflect honestly when I detect those unpleasant behaviours in others; when I can actually recognise myself on those
&ldquo;defects&rdquo;, it is a humbling and precious pragmatical lesson (to either be more tolerants with others and/or work on correcting that bad habit).

## Debates

* All #debates should be an open–minded exchange of ideas, and a collaborative quest to put them to test in order to identify the best ones.
That's the goal.
Everything else is a colourful wrapping.
It makes no sense to talk about the &ldquo;winner&rdquo; of a debate.
* Too often, the environment isn't appropriate for debate:
loud noise, big egos, bad manners, haste and the lack of a minimum conceptual base to start with are common.
Under such conditions, trying to debate is fruitless at best, and often frustrating.
Avoid.
* Always apply the [principle of charity](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Principle_of_charity).

## Fashion
* \#Fashion as such must be ignored, as long as doing so does not put you in such an outdated or ridiculous position
as to severely damage your image, reputation or relevant expectations of people about you. #Trends and #memes not backed by instrumental convenience or reason are pointless, and might even be expensive and time–consuming, so they can be safely ignored, too.

## Misc

I do not have a definite opinion on many issues, and that is OK.
I distrust those who never seem to doubt what side of the trench they're in.
How is that even possible?

Stuff has value.
That is easy to see with your car, your computer, your fancy coat: you value them, they cost you money.
But I believe humble objects have value, too.
A cheap pencil deserves &ldquo;respect&rdquo;, in a way.
Discarding or breaking small objects, tools, food, gifts without a good reason is wrong.
I can't argue well about this: I admit it's kind of spiritual, almost superstitious.
I grew up hearing my parents express *love* for small things; especially things that have to do with knowledge, education, emotions, art.
My parents would praise the simple value of a brand new notebook, a cheap book, a ballpen.
Also, a pair of shoes that are worn-out and thus a bit ugly, but that precisely because of this fit you perfectly and are extremely comfortable.
That kind of things.
I try to honour the value of those small objects, to the extent that is reasonable.

## [To be classified]

* *&ldquo;No est&aacute; dispuesto a que el &laquo;sonido ambiente&raquo; le haga confundir &laquo;lo actual con lo importante&raquo;.&rdquo;
&ldquo;Yo me reservo el derecho a elegir mis intereses y mis debates sin que me los dicten otros, por obstinados que sean.
No tengo por qu&eacute; tomar posici&oacute;n s&oacute;lo porque me lo pida quien m&aacute;s ruido hace.&rdquo;*
&mdash;&nbsp;[Javier Gom&aacute;, on an interview](http://www.elespanol.com/enfoques/20151107/77492262_0.html).

* *Vem&ouml;dalen* haunts me ([link](http://www.dictionaryofobscuresorrows.com/post/59306080288/vemodalen),

> *&ldquo;The frustration of photographing something amazing when thousands of identical photos already exist&mdash;the same sunset,
> the same waterfall, the same curve of a hip, the same closeup of an eye&mdash;which can turn a unique subject into something hollow and pulpy and cheap.&rdquo;*

* I believe radically in **free speech**, **irreverent humour**, **black humour** and **parody**.
I can't understand censorship of almost any kind.
For example, it always bugged me that [*&ldquo;Mein Kampf&rdquo;*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mein_Kampf) was effectively censored/banned in Germany for
years.

* I'm a [*militant atheist*](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VxGMqKCcN6A).

* I revere acid inonoclasts such as Tim Minchin and the late George Carlin.

* I believe in strong transparency in the corporate worl, and within organisations (eg, sharing salaries among employees).

* I don't respect the supposed privilege of specific groups to be critic with themselves, express opinions in caustic ways, or use certain words, *when members
of that group engage in those behaviours themselves*.
For the same reason that your genes, your chromosomes and your passport don't remove certain basic human rights and abilities from you (if you
think otherwise, you would be a racist, a sexist, a xenophobic)&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;for those same reasons, they don't *grant* you special privileges, either.
Example: I, as a Spaniard, have the same right to (respectfully) criticise Japan and the Japanese, or to ridicule or parody them, as Japanese people themselves.
Example: when a collective starts using a derogatory word and finally adopts and &ldquo;normalises&rdquo; it (&ldquo;queer&rdquo;, &ldquo;nigger&rdquo;,
*&ldquo;marica&rdquo;*), for me, they're implicitly letting people outside that circle use it too.
Example: the opinions of a childless person about childcare, tax exemptions for parents, paedophilia, etc. should not be dismissed, nor given a lower value than
those coming from parents.
(Yes, we can recognise the value of personal experiences; but when we're discussing statistics, averages, tradeoffs for society, etc, *your* experience raising
*your* child or children is merely an anecdote.)

* Forming (informed) **#opinions** about hard questions is a long and ardous task&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;but also a fun one, and intellectually rewarding.
Don't settle for the first opinion that sounds convincing (let alone comforting) about anything important; discovering the truth takes many reads, and opening
the mind to views that initially might seem absurd or even repulsive.

* (Related to the one above.) Escaping one's own **bubble** from time to time is hard, but important.
Our friends tend to think similar to us.
Our readings tend to enforce our views (be it fiction, essays or the news).
It is necessary a conscious effort to absorb new ideas that seem extravagant or dissenting.

* **#Envy** and **#nostalgia** are probably the two negative thoughts that affect me most often.
(And it's revealing that both feelings seem so similar!&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;nostalgia is envy of your past self; envy is nostalgia of the imagined version of you
that could have existed if only you were just as good as that other person.)
