# Ethics

## In short

### Things I believe in

* **:triangular_flag_on_post:Friendship**, as one of the greatest experiences in life.
* :triangular_flag_on_post: **RomanticLove**, although not in the absolute, binary, eternal form so often portrayed in fiction or by religion.
* Other forms of **:triangular_flag_on_post: love**.
* **#GayMarriage** (and any &ldquo;right&rdquo; that puts disadvantaged minorities *on par* with other members of society).
* Radical **#euthanasia** (apart from not processing doctors nor relatives who assist in a suicide, the State should actively help those who *really* want to
  end their lives, but who cannot do that by themselves [&sect; note](footnotes#1)).

### Things I'm not sure about

#### Gays adopting children

I *do* support **#gayAdoption**, by principle.
I do not believe that gay couples (male or female) necessarily lack any of the attributes that are important for parenthood.
Experience and science seem to have proved that children of gay couples are, on average, as healthy and happy as other children.

But I suspect there might be moral reasons to give always prefence to straight couples waiting to adopt children, *ceteris paribus*.

#### Free abortion

I feel that **#abortion** is not a yes-or-no issue.
One sign of that is that virtually everybody opposes abortion very late in the pregnancy (even strong supporters of abortive rights do not condone aborting big,
perfectly viable, completely formed fetuses that could be safely delivered in the last days/weeks of pregnancy).
Between that, and the morning-after pill, I see a spectrum of possibilities.
It's worrying that so often the &ldquo;abortion debate&rdquo; is framed in black-or-white terms.

My doubts about free abortion do not have anything to do with religion (I'm an atheist).

I do not think that the way the feminist cause has appropriated the debate is fair, nor healthy for anyone.
Of course I understand that this is not a symmetric issue, for purely biological reasons.
But I see some circumstances (perhaps *many* circumstances) where the opinion of a responsible father is of value, and should be heard.
At the very least, slogans like &ldquo;our body, we decide&rdquo;, &ldquo;it's *my* choice&rdquo;, etc. are simplistic, exclusive and polarising.

### Things I oppose

* **#DeathPenalty** (it's both immoral and ineffective).

## Immoral by proxy
