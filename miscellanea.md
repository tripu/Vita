## Being rich / being poor

It is enlightening to realise that ideas like &ldquo;rich&rdquo; / &ldquo;poor&rdquo;, &ldquo;lucky&rdquo; / &ldquo;unlucky&rdquo;; &ldquo;spoilt, posh,
uptight&rdquo; vs. &ldquo;humble, hard-working, working-class&rdquo;.

Interestingly, most of us seem to despise &ldquo;the rich&rdquo;&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;meaning by that *anyone who is richer than us*.
We don't stop to think that we ourselves are &ldquo;rich&rdquo; for other people.

An example:
In my particular case, right now (2016), I would call &ldquo;rich&rdquo; those who:
* earn more than &eur;70,000 a year,
* buy a car that cost &eur;30,000 or more,
* pay more than &eur;100 a month for a gym subscription,
* or stay at five-star hotels more often than exceptionally when they travel.
These might be some approximate definitions for &ldquo;rich, lucky, posh, spoilt&rdquo; for me, because those are all things I don't own/do.

The interesting thing here is this: if someone had asked me fiften years ago or so, I might have considered that *my current train of life is that of a
despicable, filthy posh person who can't appreciate how tough life actually is*.
And I'm not talking about the effect of *inflation* here.

Another example:
Not long ago, I was talking with a friend of mine who has been living in London for around a decade now.

## Leaked photos and videos

When people wrongly share information about other people (personal or intimate details), the moral thing is to avoid any contact with it.

When someone steals intimate photos or videos of someone else, or simply betrays the trust of the person who shared that with them in the first place, they are
acting in an immoral way.
The least society can do to prevent or discourage such behaviour is to actively avoid using and spreading that information.

I consider it is wrong to actively search online for photos &ldquo;stolen&rdquo; to celebrities, &ldquo;revenge porn&rdquo;, etc.
It makes you accomplice.
