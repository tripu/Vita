## In short

* I am a firm believer in :triangular_flag_on_post:**free software, open source, FLOSS** (call it as you wish).
  Not as a universal imposition, or the only ethical way to make software&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;but as a moral aspiration, that should be met as much as it's
  reasonable.
* I believe in :triangular_flag_on_post:**nuclear energy**.
  It is not the best source of energy, but it is better than most of the others we can rely on at the moment.
  To mention :triangular_flag_on_post:**Fukushima** in the same breath as :triangular_flag_on_post:**Hiroshima** is like discussing controlled explosions in
  mines together with bombs planted by the IRA: completely different phenomena, derived from radically opposed approaches, with very different outcomes; both
  just happen to be related to the same area of research in science and technology.
