# Children: how to treat them well as parents

## General principles

* You can't use **reason** with children, not until a certain age. Don't fool yourself thinking that they will understand why they must or must not do something, if you only explain it to them well enough.

* Be radical always telling them the truth, except when that truth. In particular, never lie to them about fairy tales, mythical characters, Christmas presents, *magic*, sex, reproduction, their own place in the world and in society.

* Be very **#consistent** with rules, orders, reasons, prizes and punishment. Assume that every time you contradict yourself it will be detected, and it will act against your own reasoning next time.

* Never express any preference for one sibling over another. Resolve disputes in the most equitative way that is possible.

* Both parents have to be well aligned. Discrepancies have to be detected and discussed.

## Day-to-day

* Be consistent with schedules and times. Exceptions should be that: exceptions.

## 

* Children aren't equipped yet to understand **#praise, #criticism or #sarcasm** — not like adults. That means that there are certain things that adults usually say to each other safely, that may be confusing or even harmful for a child:
  * When **referring to them**, a child should never hear from their parents sentences like these:
    * *“She's so annoying, all the time screaming! One more day like today and I'll kill myself.”*
    * *“You know, honey. It was enough with the first one. If we could go back in time, we wouldn't have had him, would we?”*
    * *“I wish I've stayed today with his brother instead…”*
    * *“He's dragging behind his classmates.”*
    * *“He's the smartest in his class.”*
  * When **referring to other people**, also assume that ironic sentences will be interpreted literally. Statements that are violent, hyperbolic, sexist or racist aren't a good idea, neither. A child should never hear from their parents sentences that are sexist, racist or xenophobic. Not 
    * *“Her classmates are kind of stupid, really.”*

## Language

* Try to avoid the words **#blame** and **#fault**; use **#responsibility** instead.

* Try to avoid the words **#guilt** and **#guilty**.

* Down simplify language more than strictly necessary. There's no harm in being exposed to *real*, adult language since an early age. If anything, it'll push them to absorb ideas and words, and start using it earlier.
