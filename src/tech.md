### 1. In short

* I am a firm believer in ðŸ’¡&nbsp;**free software, open source, FLOSS** (call it as you wish).
  Not as a universal imposition, or the only ethical way to make software&nbsp;&mdash;&nbsp;but as a moral aspiration, that should be met as much as it's
  reasonable.
* I believe in ðŸ’¡&nbsp;**nuclear energy**.
  It is not the best source of energy, but it is better than most of the others we can rely on at the moment.
  To mention ðŸ’¡&nbsp;**Fukushima** in the same breath as ðŸ’¡&nbsp;**Hiroshima** is like discussing controlled explosions in
  mines together with bombs planted by the IRA: completely different phenomena, derived from radically opposed approaches, with very different outcomes; both
  just happen to be related to the same area of research in science and technology.

### 2. Things I'm not sure about

* Freely available, strong, <abbr title="end-to-end">E2E</abbr> <span class="icon idea">ðŸ’¡</span>&nbsp;**encryption**.  
  I used to believe in the convenience and the fairness of opening up all kind of encryption to the masses.
  I have donated to the [EFF](https://www.eff.org/) and I am generally very sympathetic with to their causes.
  But more recently, some new information has given me pause.
  For instance, [this conversation about child abuse online](https://samharris.org/podcasts/213-worst-epidemic/).
  Today, I'm not sure about what's best.
